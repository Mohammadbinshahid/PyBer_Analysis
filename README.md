# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of the Analysis
The goal of this project is to perform exploratory analysis of Pyber ride sharing data in order to gain an understanding of ridership and fare metrics by the types of cities in which Pyber operates. 

## Results
There is a large difference between the number of drivers, number of rides, and average fare for the three types.

## Summary by City Type Data Frame

## Total Rides
Urban cities have the highest ridership demand while rural cities have the least.

### Total Drivers
Urban cities have 4x+ more drivers than suburban cities.

### Total Fares
Total Fares in 'Urban' cities with more drivers and more rides are twice the total in 'Suburban' cities and more than 9 times the total in 'Rural' cities.

### Average Fare per Ride & Driver
Rural cities have the highest average fare per ride and driver.

### Total fare by city type
Graph of Total Fares by City Type All three city types have dips and raises in the fare earned by week, and not always at the same time, showing that ridership is unique to each city type

## Summary

The smaller Rural sites with the fewest drivers and rides collect a the largest fare per ride (on average) and largest fare per driver (on average). While the larger, Urban cities with 13 times the number of total rides and more than 30 times the drivers of the Rural areas understandably earn less than a third of the average fare per Driver. This may indicate an overabundance of drivers in certain areas of the 'Urban' cities. Potentially incentivizing drivers to be available at peak times in various neighborhoods across the larger 'Urban' cities may help to spread this out somewhat. Alternatively, It seems that there may be some need to hire more drivers in 'Rural' cities while working with these 'Rural' cities to understand the distances traveled and needs of the customers.
